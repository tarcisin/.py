Who'd you become
If you could change all that you've done?
And I hope you don't mind
If life suddenly left you behind
So let the games begin
You should have known
These acts affects on your own side
Before beholder's eyes (deceiver)
As simple as it gets
Shortcuts lead you to regress
Is it really your intent?
Another bridge you burned
And I swear to God you had a choice
Another truth untold
Just get away from me
Can't you see? Time is all that we have
What we've done will forever remain
This is life, you can never go back
Better bring some morphine for the pain
Freezing into unknown (freezing into unknown)
You just reap what you sow (you just reap what you sow)
Falling in regret, seems like you have sunk too low
This is the end of your reign
Give back the time you took from me
Karma is my attack
Now get down on your knees
So full of good intentions
For those who can't see
Who'd you become
If you could change all that you've done?
And I hope you don't mind
If all your gentle lies still rot you from inside
You had your chance
Another bridge you burned
And I swear to God you had a choice
Another truth untold
Just get away from me
Can't you see? Time is all that we have
What we've done will forever remain
This is life, you can never go back
Better bring some morphine for the pain
